We position GEERT as the low-code Enterprise Integration Platform as Service (iPaaS), driving the [bi-modal](https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/bimodal/) IT strategy of Gartner. 

Our positioning is based on 3 pillars:

**1. Pillar 1: Architected models.** We empower citizen integrators (working on [mode 2](https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/bimodal/) initiatives) with architected, model driven design tools that   
  * add abstraction and automation to delivery and support processes  
  * mitigate the risk of accidental architectures  
  * create a common language to collaborate with architects and IT pros  
  
**2. Pillar 2: Full Integration Lifecycle Management support.** At https://my.emagiz.com we fully support the lifecycle of integrations, strongly focused on jointly collecting and sharing the required information to rapidly connect mode 2 initiatives to the mode 1 ecosystem  

**3. Pillar 3: Built-in patterns and best practices.** We visualize the evolvement of enterprise architectures with models throughout the several lifecycle phases and implemented an extensive set of enterprise integration patterns and best practices  

Combining architected models, full lifecycle support and built-in patterns and best practices, we drive the delivery of bi-modal IT. We help our customers increase their revenue and margins by reducing the time to market of mode 2 integrations and lowering the total costs of ownership to connect with the mode 1 ecosystem.  

Let’s sum up the key facts and figures about eMagiz and our value proposition:

  * 1 Multi-tenant iPaaS, fully supporting Integration Lifecycle Management with 100+ components
  * Managed Services: [EDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange "Electronic Data Interchange"), [ESB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus "Enterprise Service Bus") & [EAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_application_integration "Enterprise Application Integration") for 80+ food & [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself "Do It Yourself") retailers
  * We help our partners and customers drive bi-modal IT integration:
    * Reducing [TTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_market "Time To Market") of mode 1 application  integration, increasing revenue and margins of mode 2 initiatives
    * Lowering [TCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost_of_ownership "Total Cost of Ownership") of integration: smaller teams, faster implementation, reducing maintenance costs
