Version 10.7.0, released 2020-10-02

Cloud insights is there for a transparent look on the sizing of the eMagiz cloud.

New features

- Cloud insights, available from the design architecture, will provide more details on the sizing of the eMagiz cloud environment
- Deploy - Runtime dashboard: Added search fields to find runtimes easier.

Major changes
- Deploy - Releases: The widget has been converted to React. The 'Deploy release' action appears as the main option. 'Install release' option is available in the context menu instead.

Minor changes
- OData entity set name can be set by the user. The name of the root entity can be used to indicate the entity set name.
- Design - API model: The option to import from XSD file is available for this data model too. This can be found on the system message of the backend operation.

Bug fixes
- When using OData, the all entry flow is generated with a router responsible for sending the request to the correct backend system. The wrong data type names were generated in the router causing it to throw an error. Now, the correct datatype name is generated and the routing works as designed.
