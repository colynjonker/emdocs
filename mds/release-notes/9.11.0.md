Release that tackles some minor issues in the Deploy phase.

Minor changes
- Deploy - Deployment plan: When creating a default deployment plan, two steps are now included reminding you to deactivate and reactivate alert triggers. This may help you avoid alerts that are caused purely by the deployment.

Bug fixes
- Deploy - Deployment plan: In specific situations, when attempting to deploy a big bus using the deployment plan, a error could be shown instead of loading the graphical visualization of the deployment. The widget should now load again properly. (#499561)
