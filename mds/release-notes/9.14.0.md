Release that tackles some minor issues in the Deploy phase and completes our infrastructure move that was rolled out gradually over the last months.

Minor changes
- We moved our OSGi Bundle Repository – the server where all eMagiz runtimes download software updates from when deploying flows – to AWS Frankfurt. With this completed, all our (customer-facing) applications, services and servers are now located in the same region (AWS Frankfurt).

Bug fixes
- Deploy - Error messages: Fixed display issue causing all header values of failed messages being shown as empty. (Hotfix on May 20)
- Deploy - Error messages: Fixed an error when trying to view the details of error messages with more than 40 message headers. (Hotfix on May 25)

Remarks
- On May 1, new Cloud templates were made available. We strongly recommend upgrading your (AWS Cloud) environments to benefit from all the stability and monitoring improvements that come with this update. Please check the relevant release notes for instructions: for single lane environments see the R12 and R12 intermediate template release notes, for double lane environments see the R8 and R8 intermediate template release notes.
