Release that tackles some minor issues.

Minor changes
- Manage - Triggers: For a new bus, the log entry trigger that is generated automatically, will be disabled by default for both test and acceptance environments.
- Bus dashboard: The numbers for Deploy are based on the active release. This should be more accurate than the previous calculations. (#463491)
- Manage - Alerts: Alerts for acceptance and testing environments are stored for the same period as the data they are based on. This should lead to better performance of the alerting screens.

Bug fixes
- Manage - Code mappings: It is possible to select cdm codes again if more than 20 exist. (#469811)
