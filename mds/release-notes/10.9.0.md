Version 10.9.0, released 2020-10-30

Release that includes improvements in the creation of test messages in unit testing on Create phase.
New features
Unit testing: Now is possible to create test messages from Create phase and from existing test messages, either from Capture attachments of type example messages or from existing test messages from Create phase
Test messages can also be created now from the output of the debugger or the output of a running test message.
On the test messages panel is possible to edit and delete the selected test message.
Minor changes
Deploy-Releases: API GW pattern shows now correctly the diff view at operation level.
Design-Solution Design: When editing a system is possible now to add a default value for the message format either XML or JSON. This value will be used in all integrations for that system.
Bug fixes
QnA input fixed: Elements appeared next to each other (row) instead of below each other (column), this is now fixed
Deploy-Properties: Fixed two issues related to properties.
1. It is possible to save new properties from the Missing properties screen again.
2. During execution of a deployment plan, properties that are set up on another connector container, but not one the one that is being deployed, will show up as missing.
Design-Solution Design: When deleting the last gateway integration, the associated operation was deleted but not the resource. This caused a problem when transferring another integration to Create phase
