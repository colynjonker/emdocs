Release that enforces a security best practice. Besides that, this release includes several other improvements and tackles some minor issues.

Minor changes
- Manage - Alerting: The short description field on triggers has been removed, as it was unused. This makes the trigger fields look more like what you would expect in an email: A subject/summary, and a body/description.
- Security: If your password is reset, for example by using the "Forgot password" option on the login page, you will now be asked to change the password yourself when logging in.
- Minor user interface improvements across the portal.
- Upgraded part of our infrastructure that handles queue and runtime metrics for improved future performance.

Bug fixes
- Deploy - Architecture: If you only have read permissions in a bus with an AWS slot, you can now see the slot details. (#491835)
