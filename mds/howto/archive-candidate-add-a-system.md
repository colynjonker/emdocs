# How to add a system 

1. **Move** the cursor to the uniform blue rectangle in the top left corner, the system, and drag it onto the canvas. 
    _Note: it doesn’t matter if the new system is put on the left or right of the bus. If you can’t see system then click on the 4 small black squares in the top left corner and the icon for the system will appear.  
2. **Fill in** the _name_ field, this is a required field 
3. **Fill in** the _description_ field with the information about the system
4. **Fill in** the _remark_ field with which system this is connected and what information is sent
5. **Click** on _save_ and your new system is added to the canvas
