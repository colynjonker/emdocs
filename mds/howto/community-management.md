In case you have an issue with your instance that are blocking the use of the platform, and there are deadlines that result in pressure to have resolutions faster.  

Typical examples of incidents are the non-function of key features in eMagiz (properties, deployment, version management, etc) that are not working. Or larger performance issues in the eMagiz portal that are preventing to use key features. 

These kinds of incidents can be registered at https://support.emagiz.com/ and are handled by the eMagiz Support team. You would need to be registered as a user in the Support Portal. At the start of the use of eMagiz, one or more users are registered in that Portal which are allowed to register tickets. Specific guidance in which tickets should be registered is located in the Portal itself.

## Improvements

Whilst using the platform, you may notice that there are more minor-like feedbacks you will have. Specific behavior of the functionalities offered are not exactly working as expected yet do not result in an incident. Futhermore, you may have specific ideas for improving the use of the platform. 

These kinds of improvements - minor feedback and minor issues - can be registered via the eMagiz iPaaS portal itself by using the feedback button located on the right-hand side. By simply pressing the button, you make your comment or suggestion. What's very handy in this process is that you can actually take a screenshot of the page in which you are located to illustrate the issue. This will help us resolve your feedback quicker.

The eMagiz product management team is frequently reviewing the incoming feedback and will make short comments towards fixing these items. We are dedicated to resolve these issues for you. Some of these feedback items might be larger in effort and will take longer before resolved. Others may be fixed in an upcoming release. eMagiz will make discretionary decisions on these items.
