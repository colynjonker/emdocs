##### Intro

# eMagiz Event Streaming - ILM Phases
 
In this microlearning, we will discuss the data model capabilities in the Event Streaming pattern

Should you have any questions, please get in touch with academy@emagiz.com.

- Last update: November 3rd 2021
- Required reading time: 10 minutes

## 1. Prerequisites
- Completed the crashcourses of eMagiz
- Completed the fundamental - Event Streaming Introduction

## 2. Key concepts
Please refer to the introduction microlearning of this fundamental to understand all concepts.

##### Theory
  
## 3. Data models and Transformations in Event Streaming

eMagiz has the capability to define a data model for Events in the platform. Just like the other 2 patterns, the Event Streaming solution has its own distinct model. 

### 3.1 Pass-through data model
In this scenario, a topic is defined inside the model and is made available for Producers and consumers. In this scenario, a definition can be made of the topic hosted to its made clear in the platform what the structure of each message is. Futhermore, this definition is also used to display sample message structures in the Event Catalog.

### 3.2 Transformation data model
In the case where you would like to use an event processor to transform a message from a source topic to a target topic, you can leverage the standard transformation functionality in Design and Create. You can define for each topic the definitions, and then use the regular transformation tooling to make it happen. All standard functionalities are available.

##### Practice

## 4. Assignment

There is no specific assigmment here. Please review the Use case for Event streaming more closely to learn more about the configuration in eMagiz.

## 5. Key takeaways

- Leverage the capability to process transformations on data as a mean to optimize the data flow inside business processes.


##### Solution
