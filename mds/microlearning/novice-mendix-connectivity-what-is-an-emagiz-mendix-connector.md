# What is an eMagiz Mendix Connector

In this microlearning, we will focus on determining what an eMagiz Mendix Connector is. 
This insight will help you the moment you will start using the eMagiz Mendix Connector.

- Last update: March 25th, 2021
- Required reading time: 4 minutes

## 1. Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of the eMagiz platform
- Access to a Mendix application
- Access to the Deploy phase of your eMagiz project

## 2. Key concepts
This microlearning centers around learning what an eMagiz Mendix Connector is
With eMagiz Mendix Connector we mean: A Mendix module developed and maintained by eMagiz that simplifies connect a Mendix application to an eMagiz project for data traffic between both systems.

Key aspects of the eMagiz Mendix Connector:

- The goal of the module is to simplify the connection between Mendix and eMagiz and therefore enhance the speed of development and reduce the risks of problems
- The Mendix module is developed and maintained by eMagiz
- As of Mendix 8 the inner workings of the module have changed
- No manual actions in Mendix via a Mendix screen are necessary to control the eMagiz parts (as of version 4.2.0)

##### Theory

## 3. What is an eMagiz Mendix Connector

The eMagiz Mendix Connector is a Mendix module that is developed and maintained by eMagiz that simplifies connecting a Mendix application to an eMagiz project for data traffic between both systems.

Key aspects of the eMagiz Mendix Connector:

- The goal of the module is to simplify the connection between Mendix and eMagiz and therefore enhance the speed of development and reduce the risks of problems
- The Mendix module is developed and maintained by eMagiz
- As of Mendix 8 the inner workings of the module have changed
- No manual actions in Mendix via a Mendix screen are necessary to control the eMagiz parts (as of version 4.2.0)

The eMagiz Mendix Connector makes use of Java Actions (Mendix 8 and up) or a web service layer (Mendix 7 and down) to connect Mendix to eMagiz and vice versa. We have changed the connection method to create a process that is better maintainable and easier to realize.

In the remainder of the microlearnings within this module, we will learn how you can install, configure and update your eMagiz Mendix Connector. So stay tuned.
