##### Intro

# Impact of builnumber upgrades
 
In this microlearning, we will focus on the helping you to assess the impact of upgrading to new buildnumbers. 

Should you have any questions, please get in touch with academy@emagiz.com.

- Last update: August 27th, 2021
- Required reading time: 5 minutes

## 1. Prerequisites
- Advanced knowledge of the eMagiz platform
- Complete the microlearning that explains how to upgrade to a new buildnumber


## 2. Key concepts
With buildnumbers we mean the piece of software that used by a flow to make it operational inside the runtime. Several eMagiz libraries are loaded together with the flow components XML into the runtime (Java container). In essence that means that a new buildnumber means the flow is technically speaking different from the previous buildnumber.

eMagiz works hard to limit the number of buildnumbers. The general approach for buildnumber is that these are backwards compatible, so the impact of moving to the next buildnumber poses a minimal impact and risk.

##### Theory
  
## 3. Assessing the impact of changing buildnumbers



##### Practice

## 4. Assignment

Take a look at the release notes in the eMagiz Portal to ensure you know where to look.

## 5. Key takeaways

- Keep as close to the latest buildnumber as possible for the entire environment
- The best option is to have the entire environment run on the same buildnumber 
- A mix of buildnumbers in a runtime is not a good plan - conflicting behaviors may occur.
- Read the release notes for builnumbers carefully to assess the impact - in case the impact is minimal proceed with the upgrade
- Make the buildnumber upgrades planable so the release schedule takes these actions into account.

##### Solution

## 6. Suggested Additional Readings
