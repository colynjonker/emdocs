This micro learning centers around how you can create your topic based on what you have designed.
With topic we mean: A category/feed name to which event records are stored and published.

Knowing how to create a topic via the eMagiz platform makes it possible to granually make certain topics available for others to produce data on and consume data from.

Creating a topic in eMagiz is very easy. Below we will detail the specifics of how you can create a topic via eMagiz.

## 3. Create your Topic

Based on what you have designed in the Capture and Design phase you are now at the brink of Creating a topic via the eMagiz platform.

### 3.1 Transfer topic to Create

When you navigate to the Create phase of eMagiz you have the option to Add integrations to Create. This button is located on the right bottom of your screen.
If you click on this button you will arrive at a page that looks something like this:

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/microlearning/ml-create-your-topic--add-integrations.png"></p>

If you want to create a certain topic you simply select the checkbox that is still available (white background, green border) for both the producing and consuming side.

The moment you are satisfied with your choice you can Press Save Selection to tell eMagiz that you want to Create the topic(s) you have just selected.

### 3.2 Set up the Infra for Event Streaming

The first time you add a topic to the Create phase of eMagiz, as a best practice, you should also configure the Infra flow.
You can do so by accessing the context menu when you navigate to the Stream overview in Create and right click in the center of the screen but not on the topic(s) themselve(s).

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/microlearning/ml-create-your-topic--es-create-context-menu.png"></p>

After you have selected the option called Open stream Infra you only have to press Stop editing and give a description of what you have changed.
Simply fill in that this was a mandatory step to successfully setup your Event Streaming config.
