##### Intro

# Daily Monitoring

As a DevOps team, you are not only responsible for the development part. You are also responsible for the operations portion of the word DevOps. With the help of daily monitoring best practices, you can optimize this routine and improve your quality of delivery. In this microlearning, we will look at how you can best execute your daily monitoring routine with the help of the eMagiz platform.

## 1. Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of the eMagiz platform

## 2. Key concepts
This microlearning centers on daily monitoring.

Daily monitoring is defined as follows: Verifying the health of the integration data model with a particular frequency (mainly one day)

- The key aspects are:
    - The daily monitoring is executed with a particular frequency
    - The focus of daily monitoring is determining the health of the integration data model
    - The manage phase in eMagiz is crucial in successfully executing the daily monitoring
    - Daily monitoring is a team effort

As a DevOps team, you are not only responsible for the development part. You are also responsible for the operations portion of the word DevOps. With the help of daily monitoring best practices, you can optimize this routine and improve your quality of delivery. In this microlearning, we will look at how you can best execute your daily monitoring routine with the help of the eMagiz platform.

- The key aspects are:
    - The daily monitoring is executed with a particular frequency
    - The focus of daily monitoring is determining the health of the integration data model
    - The manage phase in eMagiz is crucial in successfully executing the daily monitoring
    - Daily monitoring is a team effort

As noted above the daily monitoring is executed with a particular frequency. In general, this frequency is once a day at the beginning of the day. This timing and frequency can vary if your customer(s) have different needs. When executing the daily monitoring you focus on the health of the integration data model in Production. By focusing on that you immediately have a scope of what to look for. This means that you will check out the running parts of your integration data model in Production. To help you analyze the health of the integration data model in a certain environment eMagiz has created an ILM phase called Manage.

With the help of this ILM phase, you can monitor your integration data model on a per-environment basis. To do so eMagiz provides you with:

- Error message dashboard
- Monitoring
- Statistics
- Alerting

To prevent you from browsing everything every day a crucial aspect of properly executing daily monitoring is a correct setup of your alerting rules. If you need more information and guidance on this please check out this [microlearning](crashcourse-platform-manage-alerting-in-emagiz.md). By setting up your alerting in a good manner you can easily determine which parts of your integration data model (if any) need attention.

A second very helpful portion of Manage (for our Messaging enthusiasts) is the Error message dashboard. With the help of this dashboard, you can quickly determine whether errors have occurred and if so in which flow(s) these errors have occurred. Furthermore, to keep track of the status of error messages eMagiz has the option to provide each distinctive error message with a status (To do, Doing, Done). This will make it clear to other members of your team (and perhaps even external stakeholders) what the status is of the investigation into certain error messages. If you want to learn more about the Error Message Dashboard I would advise you to read this [microlearning](crashcourse-platform-manage-determining-origin-of-error-message.md) and/or this [microlearning](intermediate-active-monitoring-determining-cause-of-error-message.md).

With these possibilities under your belt, you can quickly determine the health of your eMagiz integration data model. In case the health is jeopardized you will have to determine, in concurrence, with your team what the appropriate actions will be to fix or mitigate the problem. Also, note that it is wise to let someone else from the team do the daily monitoring each day. This way you do not create dependencies on specific individuals and the involvement of all team members in establishing a stable and healthy environment will increase.

##### Practice

## 4. Assignment

Perform daily monitoring on one of your projects. You can use the (Academy) project of your choice to perform this assignment.

## 5. Key takeaways

- The key aspects are:
    - The daily monitoring is executed with a particular frequency
    - The focus of daily monitoring is determining the health of the integration data model
    - The manage phase in eMagiz is crucial in successfully executing the daily monitoring
    - Daily monitoring is a team effort
