##### Intro

# What data is stored on runtime level
 
A vital part of the eMagiz architecture is the runtime. The runtime holds all flows related to a particular process or system. Without runtimes to run your flows on, there would be no processing of data. In this microlearning, we will zoom in on the runtime level to discern what data is stored at the runtime level.

Should you have any questions, please get in touch with academy@emagiz.com.

- Last update: November 1st, 2021
- Required reading time: 5 minutes

## 1. Prerequisites
- Advanced knowledge of the eMagiz platform

## 2. Key concepts


##### Theory
  
## 3. What data is stored on runtime level


##### Practice

## 4. Assignment

Analyze what you can learn from reading the logging that is produced on the runtime level. This assignment can be completed with the help of the (Academy) project that you have created/used in the previous assignment.

## 5. Key takeaways

- Log information (what is happening on this runtime)
- Temporary data storage (H2, in case of messaging)
- 'State' of the flow (i.e., which flow version is running and which is active)

##### Solution

## 6. Suggested Additional Readings

If you are interested in this topic and want more information, please read the release notes provided by eMagiz.

## 7. Silent demonstration video

As this is a more theoretical microlearning, we have no video that accompanies this microlearning.
