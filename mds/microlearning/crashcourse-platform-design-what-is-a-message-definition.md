## 1. Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of the eMagiz platform

## 2. Key concepts
This micro learning centers around understanding the concept of message definition

With message definition we mean: A visual representation of how the elements are related to each other, whether they are mandatory and the data types they have that can be used in the message mapping

In other words, the message definition helps you see in what structure data will be send or received

## 3. What is a message definition

A message definition is a visual representation of how the elements are related to each other, whether they are mandatory and the data types they have that can be used in the message mapping.
In all integration patterns (Messaging, API Gateway and Event Streaming) we have message definitions.

On the one hand we have message definition that relate to the system itself. This tells us something on how the system will send or receive data.
On the other hand we have message definitions that relate to eMagiz. These are generic and consistent across systems (i.e. CDM messages, Gateway messages, Topic messages).

In this phase you can open the context menu on integration level (remember, that is a line between eMagiz and a external system). 
The context menu will look slightly different per integration pattern. These differ as the use cases for each pattern differ slightly.

Selecting one of the above options will lead you to a overview similar to the one I show below

In this overview you can actualize the message definition.

## 4. Assignment

Navigate to Design and open the message definition option of atleast one integration within your project.
This assignment can be completed within the (Academy) project that you have created/used in the previous assignment.

## 5. Key takeaways

- A message definition is a visual representation of how the elements are related to each other, whether they are mandatory and the data types they have that can be used in the message mapping
- Some message definitions are specific for a system. Others are generic across systems
