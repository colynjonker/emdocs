# Using eMagiz as producer

In this microlearning, we will focus on how you can utilize eMagiz as a producer within the context of Event Streaming. In other words eMagiz will produce data to a specific topic. Other parties can in turn process the data retrieved from that topic in a manner they desire.

Should you have any questions, please contact academy@emagiz.com.

- Required reading time: 10 minutes

## 1. Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of the eMagiz platform
- Kafka cluster you can use to test against.
- Event streaming license activated

## 2. Key concepts
This microlearning centers around using eMagiz as a producer.
By using, in this context, we mean: Being able to produce data on topics that are managed within an external Kafka Cluster, such as the eMagiz Kafka Cluster.

By knowing how you can easily use eMagiz as a producer in these situations you can create event processors or create hybrid configurations (i.e. messaging to event streaming combination).

In this microlearning we will zoom in on which components in eMagiz you would need to produce data on a topic. Note that, as we learned in the previous module, eMagiz will auto generate these components when you create an event processor. If you want more information on event processors please revisit those microlearnings.

## 3. Using eMagiz as producer

By knowing how you can easily use eMagiz as a producer in these situations you can create event processors or create hybrid configurations (i.e. messaging to event streaming combination). In this microlearning we will zoom in on which components in eMagiz you would need to produce data to a topic. Note that, as we learned in the previous module, eMagiz will auto generate these components when you create an event processor. If you want more information on event processors please revisit those microlearnings.

When integrating several systems with each other it can quickly happen that a subset of those systems can only be reached via traditional messaging patterns whereas others can write and/or read data directly on a topic. In this microlearning we will focus on the scenario where eMagiz writes data to a topic. External parties will in turn consume data from said topic and use it within their own application context.

To make this work you need to identify the producing system (eMagiz), the consuming system and create a messaging offramp that will ensure that the messaging pattern is followed from the legacy systems to the topic. In the picture shown below we have illustrated this in the Capture phase of eMagiz

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/microlearning/intermediate-event-streaming-connectors-emagiz-as-producer--capture-phase-es-solution.png"></p>

To complete the picture we need to ensure that the data is received from a legacy system. Something along these lines:

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/microlearning/intermediate-event-streaming-connectors-emagiz-as-producer--capture-phase-msg-solution.png"></p>

In the Design phase you can configure your integration as explained in various of our previous microlearnings. So we will for now assume that you designed your integration as you had in mind.

### 3.1 View solution in Create

The first step after adding the integrations to Create is to see how this depiction of reality is represented by eMagiz in the Create phase. See below for the result of the Event Streaming part and for the Messaging part:

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/microlearning/intermediate-event-streaming-connectors-emagiz-as-producer--create-phase-es-solution.png"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/microlearning/intermediate-event-streaming-connectors-emagiz-as-producer--create-phase-msg-solution.png"></p>

As learned in previous microlearnings the Event Streaming part, in this case the creation of the topic is done automatically by eMagiz. We will zoom in on how you can set up your messaging exit flow in such a way that it will produce data on the topic that is automatically created by eMagiz.

### 3.2 Produce data

When you open your exit flow you will see that eMagiz has autogenerated some components for you.

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/microlearning/intermediate-event-streaming-connectors-emagiz-as-producer--create-phase-auto-generation-exit.png"></p>

Now we need to make sure that we can produce data on the topic with the help of the eMagiz components that are available in the eMagiz flow designer. In this case we will need the Kafka outbound channel adapter.

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/microlearning/intermediate-event-streaming-connectors-emagiz-as-producer--create-phase-kafka-outbound.png"></p>

As the name suggest this component can push data to a Kafka topic. Secondly we need an support object that will set up the connection between the eMagiz flow and the eMagiz Event Streaming cluster that hosts the topic. This component is called the Kafka template.

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/microlearning/intermediate-event-streaming-connectors-emagiz-as-producer--create-phase-kafka-template.png"></p>

Within this component you need to fill in several information elements. The first element is the bootstrap server URL. The bootstrap server URL is registered via a property that is build up as follows: ${nl.nameofyourparentcompany.nameofyourcompany.techninalnameofyourproject.bootstrapserver}.

Alongside the bootstrap server URL you will need to specify the client ID. You can use any name you want. The advice is to give it a descriptive name that is recognizable later on.

Last but not least on the Basic tab you need to specify that the security protocol is SSL. If you have done all of this it should look like this:

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/microlearning/intermediate-event-streaming-connectors-emagiz-as-producer--create-phase-kafka-template-basic-filled-in.png"></p>

Now that we have filled in the basics for the support object we can fill in the details for our Kafka outbound channel adapter. In here you select the output channel and link the support object to this component. Furthermore you define the topic to which you want to produce the data to.

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/microlearning/intermediate-event-streaming-connectors-emagiz-as-producer--create-phase-kafka-outbound-filled-in.png"></p>

As a result your flow should look similar as shown below:

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/microlearning/intermediate-event-streaming-connectors-emagiz-as-producer--create-phase-kafka-flow-messaging.png"></p>

### 3.3 Set up SSL connection

As you probably noticed I skipped the part on configuring the SSL connection that will ensure that the eMagiz flow can connect to the eMagiz cluster. However there is no room to escape anymore as we need it to correctly set up our connection with the topic. If you have an event processor within your project you can simply re-use the keystore and truststore that eMagiz will have automatically generate for you. If you have no event processor within your project you first need to configure an external user and do some manual steps.

To reduce the complexity of this microlearning I assume that the keystore and truststore that you need are already available within your project. First step will be to add these resources to your flow via the Resources tab on flow level.

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/microlearning/intermediate-event-streaming-connectors-emagiz-as-producer--create-phase-kafka-flow-messaging-ssl-resources.png"></p>

Now that we have these resources added to the flow we can navigate back to the support object, open the SSL tab and fill it in accordingly. For security reasons I have changed the passwords in the screenshot below.

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/microlearning/intermediate-event-streaming-connectors-emagiz-as-producer--create-phase-kafka-flow-messaging-ssl-config.png"></p>

With this configured your flow is ready to produce data on the topic.

##### Practice

## 4. Assignment

Build an exit flow that will produce data to a topic.
This assignment can be completed with the help of the (Academy) project that you have created/used in the previous assignment.

## 5. Key takeaways

- This functionality is only necessary in specific hybrid cases
- In most straightforward cases eMagiz has automated this process for you
- Don't forget to correctly connect your eMagiz flow to the eMagiz Event Streaming cluster

## 6. Suggested Additional Readings

If you are interested in this topic and want more information on it please read the helptexts within eMagiz.
