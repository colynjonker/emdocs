##### Intro

# What is Lifecycle Management
 
In this microlearning, we will focus on the concepts of lifecycle management. This we do to introduce a concept we will build upon in further microlearnings.

Should you have any questions, please contact academy@emagiz.com.

- Required reading time: 5 minutes

## 1. Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of the eMagiz platform
- Basic knowledge of the build number component within the eMagiz Platform

## 2. Key concepts
This microlearning centers around the concepts of lifecycle management.

By lifecycle management we mean: A way to stay in control of the integration landscape we are developing alongside our customers

Lifecycle management is characterized by:

- Tools to stay in control of your integration landscape.
- A way to keep up to date with the latest developments within the eMagiz portal.
- Everyone should be involved

## 3. What is Lifecycle Management

In this microlearning, we will focus on the concepts of lifecycle management. This we do to introduce a concept we will build upon in further microlearnings.

Lifecycle management is characterized by:

- Tools to stay in control of your integration landscape.
- A way to keep up to date with the latest developments within the eMagiz portal.
- Everyone should be involved

In this microlearning, we will look at the concepts of lifecycle management. In the remainder of this course and other courses on the topic, we will zoom in on parts of lifecycle management. From a conceptual standpoint, Life Cycle Management does not only entail deleting flows and information when a certain integration has reached its end of life but also keeping your integration landscape up to date with new features and developments as made by the eMagiz product development team. Life Cycle Management should be a conscious part of everyday life for everyone that plays a part within a team, project, or program. This way the team, and not the individual, will add the most value to the process.

### 3.1 Best practices

- Remove flows as part of completing your production deployment (after a grace period in which you confirm that everything works as expected). This to avoid a backlog of delete actions. A standard grace period would be two weeks. One could deviate from this standard if they have discussed this with the business owner.
- Remove flows only after written approval of the business owner of the process
- Remove flows from back to front. In other words, start in Manage and end in Capture.
- Regularly update your flows in Test and Acceptance so you can test new functionality released by eMagiz
- Updating flows to the latest build numbers can be done in two ways
    - Deploy with each production deployment a certain number of extra flows for which nothing has changed but the build number 
    - Use a separate deployment moment to upgrade all flows, without functional changes, to the newest build number

##### Practice

## 4. Assignment

Determine whether lifecycle management gets any attention within the project(s) you are currently working on.
This assignment can be completed with the help of the (Academy) project that you have created/used in the previous assignment.

## 5. Key takeaways

- Lifecycle management is characterized by:
    - Tools to stay in control of your integration landscape.
    - A way to keep up to date with the latest developments within the eMagiz portal.
    - Everyone should be involved
