## 1. Pre-requisites
- Basic knowledge of the eMagiz platform
- Understanding of Unit testing concept


## 2. Key concepts
Unit testing refers to the idea that units of developed code, or in this case integration flows/components, are tested agains fit for use. Often these unit test are run automatically to verify each individual component, but in this case the unit test are also supporting the actual development of a eMagiz flows. Unit test are always combined with specific pieces of elements that make the unit operational, such as test data, test messages, or access to services that produce data. Sometimes specific mock services are used to simulate real time behavior.

## 5. Key takeaways

Unit tests are a powerful way in which flows components can be tested without the specific need to deploy them on the eMagiz runtimes using releases and deployment plans. Individual behavior can be tested and verified, without the to run expensive debug components inside the actual flow. its recommend to maximize the use of unit tests during the development of new flows, so that issues can be fixed quicker and reproduced easily.
