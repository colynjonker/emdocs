##### Intro

# Managing your on-premises eMagiz runtime

In this microlearning, we will go into a some more details around managing your eMagiz runtime/connector 

Should you have any questions, please contact academy@emagiz.com.

- Last update: August 26th, 2021
- Required reading time: 5 minutes

## 1. Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of the eMagiz platform
- Basic knowledge of cloud management & on-premises installations of executables & services

## 2. Key concepts
With on-premises runtime we mean that the eMagiz connector is running on a client infrastructure such as a Windows or Linus based server. In some cases this can be desirable to allow integrations to connect to client systems that are also running on-premises and are secured behind firewalls. Please refer to the microlearning 0.36 to understand how to install such a runtime or find out more about eMagiz runtimes

##### Theory

## 3. Key aspects of management

1. Review memory settings in Design Architecture
In the Design Architecture you can locate the on-premises machine including the runtimes. To understand whether that machine has sufficient memory, you can right click the machine and press Check Sizing. The view below will appear.

To learn how to review and edit the actual memory settings of a runtime, please see this microlearning for more information: ([Edit memory on-premises runtimes](microlearning/intermediate-solution-architecture-edit-memory-on-premise-runtime-windows)


##### Practice

## 4. Assignment

There is no assignment for this microlearning.

## 5. Key takeaways

- The Design Architecture provides information about local runtimes as well that can be leveraged the configuration of that runtime.
